# InterfaceAnalysis

This implementation is an old Java-based project for graph-based analysis of interfaces between legacy IT systems.
The input is a matrix describing relations between IT systems. The tool performs various graph analyses.
The visualisation is realised via the yEd graph library (from yWorks).
